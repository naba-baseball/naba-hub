New Batting Stats!
- Batting Average (**AVG**)
- On Base Percentage (**OBS**)
- Slugging Percentage (**SLG**)
- On Base Plus Slugging (**OPS**)

The stat dump doesn't have a first base stat (1b), which you need for **SLG**. So I'm calculating first base like this
```js
first base = hits - second base - third base - home runs
```
if thats kinda dumb, lmk

I also updated this changelog, the years were incorrect ü§¶. Still getting used to 2023 apparently
